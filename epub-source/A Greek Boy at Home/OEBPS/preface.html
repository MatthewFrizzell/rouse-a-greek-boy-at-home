<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>T<small>HIS</small> book is meant to be used with my <i>First Greek Course</i>,
instead of the reading exercises given there: that is, the
grammar is taken in the same order. The earlier chapters
of the grammar are provided with a number of exercises, in
which the same vocabulary is generally repeated: it is hoped
that in this way the subject matter may be revised without
the need of reading the same exercise over and over again
<i>ad nauseam</i>. Thus the first reading-exercise (<a href="story1.html#ch02">II.</a>) has four
sections, <a href="story1.html#ch03">No. III.</a> has nine, <a href="story1.html#ch04">No. IV.</a> has thirteen. It is just
at first, when everything is strange, that the pupil wants to
move slowly. If he reads all these exercises, with regular
repetition of the paradigms, he ought to know the first part
of the grammar well; if he learns it before, the master may
pass on, or if he does not, no harm is done even then, since
there is something new in each section.</p>

<p>The Roman numbers correspond to the sections in the
<i>First Greek Course</i>, the exercises with Arabic numbers assume
that all the grammar has been worked through.</p>

<p>I should be grateful to any one who will tell me exactly
what effect this plan has on his boys, and at what stage exactly
each boy (or group of boys) proves to have mastered the
grammar. Similar information about the vocabulary will also
be welcome; and in particular, I wish to learn how far revision
of a given piece is needed&mdash;how much, for instance, is
learnt of the numerals after just reading aloud the exercises
<a href="story1.html#p17">pp. 17-19.</a></p>

<p>One or two dialogues are given early in the book (<a href="story1.html#ch02b">II. β</a>,
<a href="story1.html#ch03e">III. ε</a>, <a href="story1.html#ch04b">IV. β</a>): these are meant to show how the matter of any
exercise may be driven home by word of mouth. In these <span id="piv"/>
the illusion of the narrator is not kept, and the same may be
said of <a href="story1.html#ch04q">IV. θ&ndash;κ</a>; it would have been more in order to place
these in the <a href="appendix.html">Appendix</a>, but they are probably more
conveniently placed where they are.</p>

<p>I have been so fortunate as to find a number of Thrasymachus’s
school verses on a set of wax tablets; these are
given in <a href="appendix.html#app03">Appendix 3&ndash;18</a>. In places the text was corrupt,
but it has been restored by the help of Prof. J.P. Postgate
and Prof. R.S. Conway, whom I thank most sincerely for
their help, here and elsewhere in the book. The verses are
very creditable for a schoolboy.</p>

<p>The material of the book has been gathered from all
manner of sources, wherever anything could be found to
illustrate  Greek life or to interest the reader. Some of the
authors drawn on are Homer, Hesiod, Herodotus, Aeschylus,
Plato, Demosthenes, Aristotle, Menander, Aesop, Dion
Chrysostom, Aelian, and the novelists. I have used these
with the greatest freedom. The syntax and accidence is
intended to conform to the normal Attic, but the vocabulary
has generally been left alone. Those therefore who think
that only Attic words should be uttered by the tender lips of
youth will not be satisfied. For my part, I do not think a
tinge of Homer or Hesion will contaminate the taste of
anybody. Moreover, the young have a marvellous power of
forgetting, and the master may use his discretion as to what
he will let them forget.</p>

<p>My duty is done when I have warned him that the
vocabulary is very mixed.</p>

<p>The vocabulary is so arranged that the words earliest met
with are explained in English, but as soon as a few Greek
words are learnt these are used to explain the others. In
case of need, the master can always help: but there should
be no need. If this idea is new to any reader, he may be
surprised to see how little English is needed to teach the
Greek language. I may remind him that the vocabulary is a
record of what has actually been done, not what might
possibly be done: the whole of the book represents the
results of careful trials.</p>

<h3 id="hints">H<small>INTS FOR USING THE</small> B<small>OOK</small></h3>

<p>I. R<small>EADING</small>.&mdash;The book is meant to be read aloud and
explained in class. The boys should have only the text before
them, without the vocabulary, for the first reading. Progress
is slow at first, until a few Greek words are quite familiar.
It should be read first by the master, sentence by sentence,
every new word being explained by him, in English at first,
in simple Greek as soon as the necessary Greek words are
known. The boys may then read it aloud to chorus, or alone
in turn. No boy must on any account pass anything he
does not know without asking for an explanation, and he
must not be satisfied until the difficulty is cleared up. This
is a cardinal principle of language teaching, and without it
nothing can be done. The master must somehow satisfy
himself that the class does understand, partly by asking
questions, partly by causing them to read the piece aloud
after he has done so. Finally, the work is to be written out
in English for next day’s work, or prepared for oral translation.
All questions should be asked and answered in Greek,
and English used only if all else fails.</p>

<p>II. R<small>EPRODUCTION</small>.&mdash;This is as essential as the reading.
It may be done in three ways:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="dialog">(1) Questions on the text in Greek, answered in Greek
(<i>a</i>) with books, (<i>b</i>) without books, both orally and
in writing.</p>
<p class="dialog">(2) The same story retold in Greek, with the aid of an
English translation (<i>a</i>) orally, (<i>b</i>) in writing. The
English is to be used as a guide to help the
memory, and the story as told need not represent
it exactly. An excellent exercise.</p>
<p class="dialog">(3) The story re-written in Greek without this help. This
exercise is found to be too hard before the third
term. Similar subjects may later be set as themes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whenever the master gives an explanation, the class should
write it in their notebooks. They must do so by ear, no
word being spelt, and they must insert the accents, as the
master pronounces them. New words may be first written on
the board. The master must satify himself that the words <span id="pvi"/>
in the note-books are being properly written and accented,
either by walking round and looking, or by calling up boys
in turn to show their books. At first this will be slow, but
before very long he will find that most of the boys write
and accent correctly. No trouble is felt in learning the
accents as soon as they are realized as part of the word, the
chief rules being explained where necessary.</p>

<p>For revision, the vocabulary may be put into the boys’
hands. This is not meant for their use at first, since the
writing is essential in order to fix the words and forms in
the memory. Meanwhile, it will serve to help the master
until he has had practice enough to give his explanations on
the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>In his questions and the boys’ answers there is room for
new idioms when the master wishes to introduce them. Thus
the simple ἆρ’ οἶσθα or μανθάνεις or συνίης may be replaced
by τί δοκεῖ σοι, ἆρα φανερόν, ἆρα δῆλον, τίνι οὐ φανερόν, and
so forth: the answers, not only μανθάνω and so forth, but
οὐδενὶ ᾧτινι οὐ φανερόν, οὐκ ἔσθ’ ὅπως οὐκ οἶδα etc. etc. It is
surprising how many idioms may become perfectly familiar
by this incessant drill.</p>

<p>Similarly, as soon as the numerals have been read, the
class must each day be ready to tell the page and line of the
book in Greek, and references must be given in the same
way: thus ὅρα σελίδα τριακοστὴν καὶ στίχον τέταρτον.</p>

<p>Sometimes the master may tell one of the episodes aloud,
the class having no book before them, and fix it by means of
questions: they may then be told to write it out.</p>

<p>With a little ingenuity, the lessons may be made to include
anything the master wants to teach.</p>

<p>Finally, I may caution the teacher that it is not enough for
him to speak. His pupils must also speak, and the more
they speak the better.</p>

<p>These suggestions and cautions are all drawn from the
experience of my friend Mr. W.H.S. Jones and myself.</p>
